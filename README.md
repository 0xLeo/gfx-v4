# gfx-v4

## About
A simple 2D graphics library in C for educational purposes.  
Originally written by [Prof Douglas Thain](https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/courses/cse20211/fall2013/gfx/).  
The library has been modified by adding an implementation of Bresenham's line drawing algorithm and a triangle rasterisation based on the latter algorithm.
