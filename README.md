# gfx-v4

## About
A simple 2D graphics library in C for educational purposes.  
Originally written by [Prof Douglas Thain](https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/courses/cse20211/fall2013/gfx/).  
The library has been modified by adding an implementation of Bresenham's line drawing algorithm, triangle rasterisation
based on the latter algorithm, and rotations/translations to be able to animate the drawn shapes.

## How to compile
On Linux, compile with
```
make
```
Run with
```
./example
```
Clean generated executables and object files with:
```
make clean
```
